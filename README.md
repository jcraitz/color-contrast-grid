# color-contrast-grid
A little grid to show contrast combinations in a brand palette.

current feature list:
 - grid of background/foreground color combinations
 - vuejs component

next steps:
1. add a call out to the color contrast api checker
2. make a better way to show column and row text for low contrast colors.
3. suggest a better contrasting color for each row and/or column.
